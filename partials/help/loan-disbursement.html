        <p>Always ensure that the amount of simple interest is available in your bank account to avoid dishonour of the cheque.</p>
        <p>Keep photocopies of all documents/agreements/letters submitted to the bank to avoid any misunderstandings later.</p>
        <p>All banks charge interest on the loan amount from the day on which the cheque has been made and not from the day on which the cheque is handed over to you/seller. So, take delivery of the cheque the same day or the very next day to avoid paying
            extra interest on money.</p>
